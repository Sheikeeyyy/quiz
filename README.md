## How to Run
This is a client-side web application. You do **not** need to run a Python or Node.js server.

1.  Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your web browser.
2.  Or, if you are using VS Code, right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server" (if installed).

## Troubleshooting
If the application does not load (blank screen):
- The latest update includes an auto-fix for corrupted saved states. Refresh the page.
- If issues persist, clear your browser's "Local Storage" for this page.
